    <h1> Fluffy Ombre Butter Cake Recipe</h1>
    <img src="Images/layercake.jpg" alt="Chocolate Ombre Cake" >
    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p> This delicious butter cake is light, airy, and fluffy which makes it perfect for afternoon tea as it melts in your mouth.
        The cake is made with chocolate such that it creates lovely layers as seen in the image above.
        The layers are made with different variations of chocolate which are stacked from dark to light and then finaly a white vanilla layer.
        The cake can be layered with the darkest layer either at the bottom or the top.
        However, if the vanilla layer is placed in the middle of the two chocolate layers, the cake loses its ombre effect.

        This cake is prepared in an 8sq inch pan. Line the pan, grease the sides. 
        Preheat the oven at 180C as you prepare the batter.
